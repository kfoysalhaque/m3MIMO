# m3MIMO

This is the implementation of the paper [m3MIMO: An 8×8 mmWave Multi-User MIMO Testbed for Wireless Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3636534.3697321).

<br/>

### In this paper, we present m3MIMO a mmWave fully-digital multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) testbed for advanced wireless research. m3MIMO operates in the 57-64 GHz frequency range and supports up to 1 GHz of bandwidth enabling large data multiplexing in the frequency domain through orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).
